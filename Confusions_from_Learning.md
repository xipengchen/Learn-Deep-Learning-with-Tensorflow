# Confusions From Learning Process

### :one: :question: What if the deep learnign model make false prediction in real porject?
For CNNs, build a model and evaluate the model, the confusion matrix shows there are false prediction labeling of the image. 
So how can we do about the false prediciton if the model in the production level.
