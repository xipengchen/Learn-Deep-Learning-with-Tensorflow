### Warm-up:
* Paperspace Blog — [Recurrent Neural Networks](https://blog.paperspace.com/recurrent-neural-networks-part-1-2/)
* WILD ML — [Introduction to RNNs]()
### Go deeper:
* Andrej Karpathy blog — [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks]()
* Stanford CS224n — [Lecture 8: Recurrent Neural Networks and Language Models]() (recommend going through the whole course + exercises)
### Advanced (grasping the details):
* Tensorflow — [Recurrent Neural Networks]()
* arXiv paper — [A Critical Review of Recurrent Neural Networks for Sequence Learning]()
