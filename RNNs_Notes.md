## Resources to Understand RNNs better:
### Warm-up:
* Paperspace Blog — [Recurrent Neural Networks](https://blog.paperspace.com/recurrent-neural-networks-part-1-2/)
* WILD ML — [Introduction to RNNs](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-1-introduction-to-rnns/)
### Go deeper:
* Andrej Karpathy blog — [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](https://blog.paperspace.com/recurrent-neural-networks-part-1-2/)
* Stanford CS224n — [Lecture 8: Recurrent Neural Networks and Language Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keqep_PKrY8&t=1080s) (recommend going through the whole [course + exercises](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/))
### Advanced (grasping the details):
* Tensorflow — [Recurrent Neural Networks](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/text_generation)
* arXiv paper — [A Critical Review of Recurrent Neural Networks for Sequence Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.00019.pdf)
