## Notes For Machine Learning

### 1. What is Machine Learning?
* Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.
* Using algorithms that iteratively learn from data, machine learning allows computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed where to look

### 2. Split Data to Three sets 
* Training Data
* Validation Data
* Test Data (Difference with Validation data in real projects)

### 3. [Difference](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-are-overfitting-and-underfitting-in-machine-learning-a96b30864690) of Overfitting and Underfitting

### 4. Model Evaluation
#### Classification Metrics
* Accuracy
* Recall
* Precision
* F1-Score
